Parallel computing with GPU for bandwidth selection applied to nonparametric estimation of risk-neutral densities associated with option prices.

Implements MATLAB code, C code for sequential computing, and CUDA code for parallel computing.
The repository includes 3 main directories:

matlab

It includes code and data to perform bandwidth selection and risk-neutral density estimation 
using MATLAB code. There are two data sets, VIX and S&P500, for which two scripts vix.m and
sp500.m, can be used to perform the calculations. For more information on how to run the 
scripts, within the directory exists a file README.md, and the script are anotated to
facilitate eventual parameters tuning.

vix 

It includes code and data o perform bandwidth selection and risk-neutral density estimation 
using using C and CUDA, the first to a sequential implementation, whereas the second implements a sequential.
The code needs to be compiled through the compiler nvcc, and the choice of sequential (CPU) or 
parallel (GPU) is made through an input in running the application. 

Example:
- compile the code
     
          nvcc main.cu -o vix
          
          
     
- running the application
   - iterative introduction of the inputs
          
          ./vix

      
   - inputs given when the application is deployed  <br />
          - ngrid number of elements in hc and hp grid <br />
          - hcmin lower value for hc <br />
          - hcmax upper vallue for hc <br />
          - hpmin lower valor for hp <br />
          - hpmax upper value for hp <br />
          - nx number of elements of the x grid <br />
          - xmin lower value for x <br />
          - xmax upper value for x <br />
          - cpugpu a flag for sequential or parallel -- 0 for cpu; 1 for gpu <br />
        
          example for cpu
          ./vix 256 0.75 2.0 0.75 2.0 128 10.0 47.5 0
          example for gpu
          ./vix 256 0.75 2.0 0.75 2.0 128 10.0 47.5 1
        
        
sp500

The structure is in all identical to the vix, serves only to separate data sets.

Example:
- compile the code

          nvcc main.cu -o sp500
        
- running the application
   - iterative introduction of the inputs


          ./sp500
       
   - inputs given when the application is deployed
    
          example for cpu
          ./sp500 256 0.25 1.25 0.25 1.25 128 24.0 28.0 0
          example for gpu
          ./sp500 256 0.25 1.25 0.25 1.25 128 24.0 28.0 1
